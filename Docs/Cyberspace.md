## Cyberspace
This document summarizes how the United States Department of Defense (DoD) describes the cyberspace domain. 

**Cyberspace**  
Cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. 

**DODIN**  
The Department of Defense (DOD) Information Network (DODIN) is the DOD’s portion of cyberspace. It includes classified and unclassified networks and many other components, including DOD-owned smartphones, radio frequency identification tags, industrial control systems, isolated laboratory networks, and platform information technology. At corps and below, the network component of the command-and-control system is the DODIN. Signal forces protect the DODIN from unauthorized activity by conducting DODIN Operations and Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) - Internal Defense Measures (DCO-IDM)

**DODIN Operations**  
DODIN Operations are missions to install, operate, maintain, secure, and sustain DOD cyberspace to create and preserve the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the DODIN (i.e., the ability to execute the Command and Control warfighting function). It is one of the three DOD cyberspace missions. The other two are DCO and Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO). DODIN Operations consists of three critical tasks: Enterprise Management, Content Management, and Cybersecurity (aka Cyberspace Security).

**DCO**  
DCO are missions to preserve the ability to utilize “blue cyberspace” capabilities and protect data, networks, cyberspace-enabled devices, and other designated systems by defeating on-going or imminent malicious cyberspace activity. The term blue cyberspace denotes areas in cyberspace protected by the United States, its mission partners, and other areas the DOD may be ordered to protect. DCO are further categorized, based on the location of the actions in cyberspace, as either DCO-IDM or DCO – Response Actions (DCO-RA). 

**DCO-IDM**  
DCO-IDM missions involve actions to locate and eliminate cyber threats within friendly networks. Cyberspace forces employ defensive measures to neutralize and eliminate threats, allowing reestablishment of degraded, compromised, or threatened portions of the DODIN. Cyberspace forces conducting DCO-IDM primarily conduct Cyberspace Defense tasks, but may also perform some tasks similar to Cyberspace Security.

**Cyberspace Security**  
Cyberspace security includes tasks executed within protected cyberspace to prevent unauthorized activity.  

**Cyberspace Defense**  
Cyberspace defense includes tasks executed within protected cyberspace to detect and respond to unauthorized activity. Cyberspace defense formally replaced the term “Computer Network Defense (CND)” after the issuance of Joint Publication 3-13, “Information Operations.”  

**Cyberspace Protection**  
Cyberspace security and cyberspace defense tasks are collectively referred to as cyberspace protection.
